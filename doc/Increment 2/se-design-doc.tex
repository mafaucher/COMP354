\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to provide the reader with an understanding of the design of the \systemName system. Each section provides differing levels of detail. We begin with a high-level description of the architectural design followed by a detailed description of the Model, View and Controller subsystems. We conclude the document with examples of execution scenarios to provide the reader with concrete examples of design data flow.

\section{Architectural Design} \label{sec:arch}

A foundational background of the overall system is required in order to understand the goals of the respective subsystems and their relationships.

\subsection{Architectural Diagram}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=.5]{Diagrams/archDiagram.png} \end{center}
\caption{Architectural Design Diagram}
\label{fig:arch-diagram}
\end{figure}

The \systemName consists of three main subsystems; Model, View, and Controller. This design was chosen due to its feasibility and synergy with simple Graphical User Interfaces. 

The Model is the hub for all essential data and data manipulation. It interfaces with input/output classes to read and write data to XML and text files. Additionally, it handles all operations that directly modify the Person and Tasks information.

The View supports the user inteface. It is used to display information to the user in varying table modes.

Finally, the Controller facilitates communication and data synchronization between the Model and View subsystems. It acts as an intermediary and allows for a highly cohesive and lowly coupled interface environment. 

\subsection{Subsystem Interface Specifications}

The following flowchart displays the various subsystems of the \systemName. Each column represents a subsystem, except for I/O which is a part of the Model subsystem. The arrows represent specific function calls used in order to communicate between subsystems. The legend discusses the interface relationships and how they are used cross-subsystem to achieve different functional goals. Please refer to the UML sequence diagrams for more examples related to the interfacing between subsystems.

\section{Detailed Design} \label{sec:detail}

As stated previously, the system is composed of the Model, View and Controller subsystems.

\subsubsection{Units Description}

{\bf Controller}
\begin{quote}
{\bf Description}\\
This class contains MainModel varaible, MainWindow variable and 4 listeners. MainModel is a model attribute which has underlying data and methods to manipulate the data (read, update, write to files). The MainWindow is the main application window class, which contains 2 views: PersonView and TaskView.\\\\
{\bf Attributes:}\\
\texttt{MainModel mm}\\
\texttt{Mainwindow mw}\\ 
\texttt{class TaskTableListener}: \emph{The object of this class is attached to TableModelListener of the \texttt{jTable}.  When the table is edited the listener\\ \texttt{tableChanged(TableModelEvent e)} catches the event, which first updates the model, writes new changes to XML by calling \texttt{mm.updateXML()} in the MainModel and then reloads the table with new data by calling\\ \texttt{mw.updatePeopleTable(mm.getPeopleData())} in the MainWindow.  }\\
\texttt{class PrintPeopleListener}: \emph{The object of this class is attached to Action Listener of the \texttt{btPrintPeople} button in the MainWindow \texttt{mw}. When user presses on the button ``Print People Table", the event is caught and this class calls the method \texttt{mm.writePeopleTxt()} in the MainModel.}\\
\texttt{class RemoveTaskListener} \emph{The object of this class is attached to the action listener of the \texttt{btRemove} button in the MainWindow \texttt{mw}.  When users presses on the button ``Remove Task", this event is caught and this class calls finds the Task which is about to be removed in the model,  removes it, then updates both Tables, and also writes new changes to XML file by calling \texttt{mm.updateXML()}.}\\
\texttt{class AddTaskListener}\emph{The object of this class is attached to the action listener of the \texttt{btAdd} button in the MainWindow \texttt{mw}. When user presses on the button ``Add Task", this event is caught and this class creates a new Task, adds it to the model, updates both People and Tasks tables, and also writes new data to XML file by calling \texttt{mm.updateXML()}.}\\\\
{\bf Methods:}\\
\texttt{void updatePeopleTable(List<Person> pList)}: \emph{Creates and initializes a new \texttt{MainModel} and creates and initializes a new MainWindow which contains two panels: PersonView and TaskView.}
\end{quote}

\section{Dynamic Design Scenarios}

The following sequence diagrams represent three execution scenarios of the system. Each diagram follows the flow of data through the system design to achieve a system-level service. Note that the execution scenario for removing a task is almost identical to the scenario for adding a task.
